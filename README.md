# 117Lynx
![Old Imageboard Banner](https://github.com/maksrago/117Lynx/blob/master/templates/images/banners/g/banner_2.png?raw=true)

117Lynx was the front end used on the now dead, satirical imageboard 117chan.org. 117Lynx is a fork of [PenumbraLynx](https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/PenumbraLynx) and uses much of the code present in Penumbra. 117chan was made possible thanks for StephenLynx and his project [LynxChan](https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/PenumbraLynx). The backend of 117chan was based off of an older version of LynxChan.

**This project is now retired and will no longer be updated**, however, I think that those looking to learn more about Javascript, HTML, and CSS could learn quite a lot from this source code, so please take a look at it (I know it's messy, but hey, you might learn something new).

## Required software (Grabbed from [LynxChan's README.md](https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/LynxChan/blob/master/Readme.md))
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 10.x, I suggest installing from source code. DO NOT build the master's HEAD.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) 4.0.x.
* [UnZip](http://www.info-zip.org) 6.00, this is probably already include in your distro, though.
* [cUrl](http://curl.haxx.se) 7.29.0, this is usually included too.
* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) 6.7.8-9
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (Optional) 4.0 if mediaThumb setting is enabled. Requires zlib-devel on centOS to work properly when compiled from source.

## Back-end
The back-end used for 117Lynx is no longer available, and was never publicly released. You can, however, use the vanilla version of 117Lynx version 1.9, found [here](https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/LynxChan/tree/1.9.x). If you have questions about setting up an older version of LynxChan, reach out to the developer Stephen Lynx.
