<h1>Moderation Manual</h1>
<p class="nonBoardSubText">General information pertaining to being a volunteer</p>

<div class = "gAnnounce">
<p id="globalAnnouncement"></p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2">Global Moderation</h2>
<p>Any account have a numeric global role assigned to it. If this role is lesser than 4, it means the user is in the global staff. </p>

<ol>
<li>Root: 0</li>
<li>Admin: 1</li>
<li>Volunteer: 2</li>
<li>Janitor: 3</li>
</ol>

<p>Anything above 3 or undefined is considered a regular user. Janitors are able to delete any post or thread on the site and to close global reports.</p>

<p>Volunteers are able able to lift and issue any kind of global ban.</p>

<p>Admins are able to add or remove volunteers and janitors, to delete and transfer boards. They are also able to create boards when board creation is disabled.</p>

<p>Roots are able to assign admins.</p>

<p>The first admin or root will have to have it's role set using the terminal arguments. Consult the readme.md on src/be for instructions on that. Any role have all the powers of the less <span title="[TRIGGER WARNING] :^)">privileged</span>roles. When your account has access to the global staff tools, a link on your account page will be displayed.</p>
</div>


<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2">Board Moderation</h2>
<p>A board have it's board owner and board volunteers. Board volunteers are added by the board owner and are able to delete content on the board, lock, pin, make threads cyclic, close board reports, change board settings, and apply bans for the board.</p>

<p>Board owners are able to do that, plus they are able to transfer or delete their own boards, add board banners, filters, custom css and rules.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2">Custom CSS</h2>
<p>Board owners can add a css file to their boards, just using the upload form on the board management page. To delete the custom css file, click the upload button without entering any files.
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2">Reports</h2>
<p>Any non-banned user is able to report content, as long as said content haven't been reported yet.</p>
<p>Open reports will be displayed on the main moderation page with a link to the reported content and a button to close the report.</p>
<p>Closed reports are not deleted until the content they relate to is deleted. It is also possible to ask for the engine to delete the reported content when closing the reports.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2">Deleting Content</h2>
<p>As long as you are logged in, your global role and board role will be verified when you try to delete content AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INPUT A PASSWORD.</p>
<p>If you input a password, your account will not be validated and the system will try to use the deletion password you provided.</p>
<p>Not only its possible to delete content, but also to only delete the files posted on the content.</p>
<p>Regular file deletion will just remove the reference to the file, while media deletion will actually wipe the file from the site. Media deletion is only usable by global staff.</p>
<p>Global staff is also allowed to use a clear IP to delete content from this IP across the whole site. Board staff can use IP deletion, but it will be restricted to the board of the first selected post to be deleted by IP deletion.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Bans</h2>
<p>To apply bans, select the checkboxes on the left top corner of postings and write a duration for the ban. The format used is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>y</b>: amount of years.</li>
<li><b>M</b>: amount of months.</li>
<li><b>d</b>: amount of days.</li>
<li><b>h</b>: amount of hours.</li>
<li><b>m</b>: amount of minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you write "2d 1h" it will create a 49 hour ban. The order of amounts and spacing doesn`t matter. The same could be "1h 2d".</p>
<p>Board staff is also required to fill the captcha.</p>
<p>Bans can be lifted from the bans page that can be accessed from the moderation pages.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can enter the ban reason and message. The ban message will be displayed on the post itself instead of the default ban message set in the site configurations. Global staff with the power to apply bans can select the checkbox to apply a global ban.</p>
<p>The ban reason will appear for both the user and on the bans list.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Range Bans</h2>
<p>It is also possible to ban entire ranges of ips. When banning an user, select the ban mode. Range bans can use either the first half or the first three quarters of the user ip. Alternatively, it is possible to manually ban a known IP on the range bans page.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Hash Bans</h2>
<p>Files can also be banned, keeping anyone from posting them. Copy the md5 of the file shown in the thread moderation page and input it on the hash bans page.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Board Settings</h2>
<p>There are many ways to customize how a board works in general.</p>

<p>The [code] tag allows for posts to transform text in this tag into a non-formated text that is best used to display code.</p>

<p>The name used for anonymous posters, board name and description can also be changed.</p>

<p>Board message will be displayed above the posting form and accepts any most of posting markdown plus custom links using [displayed text](address).</p>

<p>Adding a custom CSS will cause this file to be used after all other CSS files on board, thread and catalog of the board.</p>

<p>A custom JS can only be added if allowed by the global setings.A custom spoiler will replace any spoiled files on the board.</p>

<p>Location flags can be toggled. They won't work if the site doesn't have the location data installed.</p>

<p>Custom flags can be selected by users when they post, being shown in place of a flag representing their location.</p>

<p>Tags will be shown on the board listing and can be used to search for boards. aptcha mode allows for greater control on when an user has to use a captcha to post. Not only is possible to set for captchas to be required always or never, but it's also possible to set it to be used only when creating threads.</p>

<p>Textboard mode will disable the uploading of files entirely. It is alsopossible for users be required to always upload at least one file when creating a new thread.</p>

<p>Unique files and posts will require that users do not upload files that are already present on the board or that post similar posts.</p>

<p>By default users have an id unique to them inside threads, this feature can be disabled for greater anonymity.</p>

<p>If you set users to not be allowed to delete their own posts, only staff members will be allowed to delete them.</p>

<p>If forced anonymity is toggled, then users won't be able to use a name when posting. They will still be allowed to use role signatures, however.</p>

<p>Early 404 will cause threads that have less than 5 replies to be deleted when they leave the top third threads.</p>

<p>It is possible to make some posting more strict than the global values:</p>

<ol>
<li>Amount of files</li>
<li>Maximum size for files</li>
<li>Maximum amount of threads on the board</li>
<li>Maximum amount of replies on threads</li>
<li>Valid file formats that can be uploaded to the board.</li>
<li>Any value greater or not included on the global values will be ignored.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Filters</h2>
<p>Filters change a term for another term.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Banners</h2>
<p>One can add customized banners for a board, they will be displayed randomly for users.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Rules</h2>
<p>Rules can be written and will be made visible on the rules.html page of the board.</p>
</div>

<div class = "tableOutside">
<h2 class = "table_h2" id="banSection">Board Message Markdown</h2>
<p>It is similar to standard posting markdown with some differences:</p>

<p>It won't handle quotes.</p>

<p>Links won't be handled the same way, you have to use standard markdown for them. For example: [A link](http://hurr.durr) becomes <a href="http://hurr.durr">A link</a>, the [code] tag won't be applied.</p>
