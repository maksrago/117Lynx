   <h2>I've got a DMCA takedown request that I can prove ownership of. What can I do? </h2>
   <p>You can use the Report boxes and submit a request. You NEED to provide proof of ownership of some sort to prove it's a valid DMCA case. A DMCA Case ID is also sufficient. I usually check daily this website for new reports and ban the image globally, deleting the file forever and stopping it from being downloaded in the future. If within a week I have not taken down a reported post, please e-mail me (details on the contact page). Do note that if it's the same image being reposted, you can report it just once and I'll globally ban and remove it. </p>
